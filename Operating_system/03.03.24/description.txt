Multi-Threading
============================
Multiple threads to resolve race condition we have used lock and unlock. The lock unlock area is called critical area
For lock unlock we have used mutex and semaphore(it also can use multiple process)
Task: Lock unlock using semaphore;

pthread_mutex key
pthread_mutex_lock
pthread_mutex_unlock

semaphore_t sem_key;
sem_init(&sem_key, 0,1)
sem_wait(&sem_key) it works like as pthread_mutex_lock
sem_post(&sem_key) it works like as pthread_mutex_unlock

Multi-Process
